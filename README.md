# BPF-for-audio-with-variable-cutoff-frequency-by-user
This project designs an adaptive BPF in MATLAB, allowing users to set lower and upper cutoff freq to enhance audio quality. It isolates desired frequencies while reducing noise. The system loads file, applies the filter, analyzes time-frequency characteristics, and saves the output. This improves speech, music, and noise reduction applications.
 In this project, we aim to apply a band-pass filter to an audio file, with the cutoff frequencies
 defined by the user. The flexibility of variable cutoff frequencies allows for greater control and
 precision in audio manipulation. This capability is especially useful in fields like music
 production, noise reduction, and speech processing, where different frequency ranges are
 emphasized or suppressed to enhance the audio quality or remove unwanted noise
 One of the key aspects of this project is allowing the user to input the desired cutoff frequencies
 for the band-pass filter. This user-driven control offers significant flexibility and adaptability to
 different scenarios. For instance, the user may want to emphasize frequencies between 300 Hz
 and 3000 Hz, the typical range of human speech, in a communication system to ensure clear
 transmission. Alternatively, the user may want to filter out certain frequencies in music
 production to make room for other instruments or effects. This approach allows the filter to be
 tailored to the specific requirements of the task, making it more versatile than a filter with fixed
 cutoff frequencies
